"View up-to-the-minute traffic camera images of current road conditions on major routes as well as other key intersections. *These cameras are solely for traffic monitoring and not enforcement. Camera footage is not recorded. Cameras can be down for maintenance or in the case of collisions, to protect the identity of those involved.*"
